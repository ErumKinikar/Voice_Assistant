 The Basic Voice Assistant is a simple program designed to perform basic tasks in response to voice commands. It can handle actions such as greeting the user with predefined responses when addressed with "Hello," providing the current time or date, and searching the web for information based on user queries. This voice assistant serves as an introductory project in voice recognition and natural language processing, offering users a hands-free way to interact with their computer for basic tasks.
